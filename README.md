# 🦴🖥️ ssh-man

<br>

ssh-man is an SSH manager. I often forget the credentials and IPs to servers I frequently SSH into so Im making ssh-man to help me remember my credentials for these servers.

I didnt know about `.ssh/config`.... thanks Adrian. Nonetheless Im still working on this so :)

## Plans
- [ ] Connect to the server instead of printing SSH command
- [ ] Prettier output by probably just adding some colors
